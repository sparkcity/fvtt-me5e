## Notes

- As a hobby project, development will take place as time allows. My focus will largely be making sure it stays compatible with Foundry core updates and Dungeons & Dragons system updates. I will add new features if possible when I have the time.

## Features

- Compendiums:
  - Bestiary
  - Backgrounds
  - Classes (with subclasses)
  - Class Features (with subclass features)
  - Feats
  - Item Catalogue (with: armor, weapons, weapon mods, armor mods, grenades, programs, and more)
  - Racial Features
  - Spells
  - Vehicles

(NOTE: Races from ME5e are copyright infringing and will not be included in this module. Similarly, any potentially copyright infringing entries have been left out of the Bestiary and will not be added.)
