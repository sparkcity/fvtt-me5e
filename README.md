## Limitations
Due to current limitations and a limited amount of time, there is no 'click to roll' function for the custom skill of Vehicle Handling. Instead, the place next to Vehicle Handling that says 'undefined' upon creating a new character sheet is a text box that will allow for manual tracking of what the modifier should be. Delete the 'undefined' text and replace with with whatever the modifier should be, positive or negative.
