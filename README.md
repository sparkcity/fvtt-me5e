# Notes

## By the Author

As a hobby project, development will take place as time allows. My focus will largely be making sure it stays compatible with Foundry core updates and Dungeons & Dragons system updates. I will add new features if possible when I have the time. Contributions are welcome from anyone interested in testing and adding features.

## Development

### Adding new icons

Most icons have been sourced from game-icons.net. Depending on the item and if they have varying rarities, the icons are downloaded with fill colors according to the rarity. Hex colors as follows:

- Common: #ffffff
- Uncommon: #7ed321
- Rare: #48baff
- Very Rare: #bd10e0
- Legendary (Spec): #d30707
