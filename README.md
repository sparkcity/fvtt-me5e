# Notes

## By the Author

- As a hobby project, development will take place as time allows. My focus will largely be making sure it stays compatible with Foundry core updates and Dungeons & Dragons system updates. I will add new features if possible when I have the time. Contributions are welcome from anyone interested in testing and adding features.
- This is an imperfect implementation of ME5E, but my main goal was to make the compendiums of items, classes, features, and such available to those wanting to run the system. Making an assortment of items can be a tedious process and can feel like a blocker that stops you from playing a system. My hope is that this will help facilitate more people playing. Because of that, and wanting to make it available easily through the official Foundry VTT distribution process of modules, an abundance of caution has been taken in making sure to not to infringe on copyright. This means some names may be changed or obfuscated and some things may have to be omitted entirely.

## Development

### Adding new icons

Most icons have been sourced from game-icons.net. Depending on the item and if they have varying rarities, the icons are downloaded with fill colors according to the rarity. Additionally, the classes and their subclasses have their own hex colors according to their shields on the source website being eyedropped. Hex colors as follows:

- **Rarities**
  - Common: #ffffff
  - Uncommon: #7ed321
  - Rare: #48baff
  - Very Rare: #bd10e0
  - Legendary (Spec): #d30707
- **Classes**
  - Adept: #5a4a86
  - Engineer: #c5791e
  - Experiment: #5b7e9d
  - Explorer: frame #5a4a86; background #f5a623; foreground #ac2b35
  - Infiltrator: background #ac2b35; foreground #c5791e
  - Musician: #64ffda
  - Sentinel: background #5a4a86; foreground #c5791e
  - Soldier: #ac2b35
  - Tracker: #22b14c
  - Vanguard: foreground #5a4a86; background #ac2b35
